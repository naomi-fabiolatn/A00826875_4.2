# Data Processing Scripts

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains three Python scripts that handle different data processing tasks:

1. **Compute Statistics**: Reads numbers from a file and computes statistical measures.
2. **Convert Numbers**: Converts decimal numbers to binary and hexadecimal.
3. **Word Count**: Counts the frequency of words in a text file.

Each script is designed to handle **file input, mathematical computation, error handling, and console output**.

## 🚀 Features

### **1️⃣ Compute Statistics**
- Reads numerical data from a text file.
- Computes:
  - Mean (average)
  - Median
  - Mode
  - Variance
  - Standard Deviation
- Saves results in `StatisticsResults.txt`. (Example executed with file: fileWithData1.1.txt)

### **2️⃣ Convert Numbers**
- Reads decimal numbers from a file.
- Converts each number into **binary and hexadecimal**.
- Saves results in `ConversionResults.txt`. (Example executed with file: fileWithData1.2.txt)

### **3️⃣ Word Count**
- Reads words from a text file.
- Counts word occurrences.
- Saves results in `WordCountResults.txt`. (Example executed with file: fileWithData2.1.txt)
